# Insecure Access to Route Parameters in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common vulnerability in Express.js applications: insecure access to route parameters.  Failure to properly validate and sanitize parameters can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. 

## Vulnerability

The `bug.js` file showcases a route that directly accesses a route parameter (`userId`) without any validation or sanitization. This exposes the application to potential issues such as:

- **Unexpected Behavior:** If the `userId` parameter contains unexpected characters or data types, it can cause errors or unexpected behavior in the application.
- **Security Risks:**  Malicious actors might attempt to inject harmful data through the parameter, potentially leading to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a more secure approach. It validates the `userId` parameter to ensure it conforms to the expected format (in this case, a positive integer) before using it in further operations.

This example shows the importance of properly validating and sanitizing all input data, including route parameters, to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure secure application behavior.
